### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Just finished my boot camp at Denver University for Full Stack Development! I'm now continuting my education through Udemy courses, reading, and lots of pratice. My main focus is on front end development and web design. I've also become very interested in creative javascript. With a background in fine art <canvas> and draw() are two things I know very very well. 

I'm looking forward to starting my TA role in February and on the hunt for full time or contract work! Eager to learn and start this career path! 

You can reach me at fitzmauricejillian@gmail.com 
       
 Cheers!
